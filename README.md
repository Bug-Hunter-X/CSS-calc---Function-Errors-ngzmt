This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using the CSS `calc()` function.  The `bug.css` file contains code that illustrates the problem, while `bugSolution.css` provides the corrected version.  The primary issue stems from a misunderstanding of operator precedence and unit consistency within `calc()` expressions.  Proper usage involves ensuring all values within `calc()` have compatible units and that expressions are correctly parenthesized to enforce the intended order of operations.
