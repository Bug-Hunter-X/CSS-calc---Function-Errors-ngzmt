The CSS `calc()` function can sometimes produce unexpected results if you're not careful with operator precedence and unit consistency.  For example, `width: calc(100% - 10px);` works fine, but `width: calc(100% - 10);` will likely fail because you're subtracting a dimensionless number from a percentage.  Another issue can arise from nesting `calc()` expressions improperly, leading to parsing errors.
